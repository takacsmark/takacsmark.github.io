## tl;dr

In this article we take Stackoverflow data dumps and analyze vital aspects of the Node.js ecosystem and identify action points that you can address right now.

**Let me summarize the key trends you find in the article in case you don’t have the time to read the whole thing.**

- **General Javascript trends play a key role in the use of Node.js**. New additions like Ecmascript-6 and Promises, JWT and the rise of Typescript greatly influence how Node.js is used in projects.
- **Server side is the main area of use, with Express** as the main tool, Node.js is widely used to build and run web servers and APIs. Frameworks like Express and Sails, or popular full stack solutions like the MEAN stack further strengthen Node's positions in the back-end.
- The server side use case introduces **MongoDB and Mongoose as key tools**. MySQL also made it to the top 10 tags used with Node.js
- Nojde.js is used with a wide variety of **cloud platforms** on the server side.
- **Angular and React** are the hottest overall Javascript topics these days, they are often used together with Node.js, too.

**I’ve put the summary of the action points from the article right here.**

_Industry trends where you should be active right now._

- Use Angular or React to create fresh user experiences and applications for desktop and mobile.
- Use Express with Node.
- Connect your Node applications to MySQL and MongoDB.

## Top tags in the Node.js domain

Let's continue our Javascript trends analysis with trending Node.js tech based on Stackoverflow data dumps!

**This article is an extension to my [previous article about Javascript trends](https://takacsmark.com/25-top-javascript-trends-actions-2019-stackoverflow-data/){:target="\_blank"}; this time we take a closer look at what's hot in the Node.js ecosystem and what concrete actions you can take today to keep up with the trend.**

You can find a pretty neat overview of Javascript trends with figures in the previous article, so I'd suggest to check it out before moving on right now, because in this article, we just jump right into Node.js without discussing the broader domain of Javascript. You can find that article here <https://takacsmark.com/25-top-javascript-trends-actions-2019-stackoverflow-data/>.

I published that article almost two months ago. I know, it's been a while, please forgive my little delay, I was busy with some data crunching related client work.

**We learned in the Javascript article that Javascript is the main tool to build any and everything front-end related including web and mobile applications and desktop apps.**

We found that Angular, React and Vue are the top growth segments of Javascript. Node.js came out as a top use-case, too.

The table below shows the top Stackoverflow tags used next to Node.js on Stackoverflow questions.

</table>
Based the table and the more detailed data that I share with you later in the article, we can identify the following key patterns of Node.js use-cases.

- **General Javascript trends play a key role in the use of Node.js**. New additions like Ecmascript-6 and Promises, JWT and the rise of Typescript greatly influence how Node.js is used in projects.
- **Server side is the main area of use, with Express** in the 3rd place, Node.js is widely used to build and run web servers and APIs. Frameworks like Express and Sails, or popular full stack solutions like the MEAN stack further strengthen Node's positions in the back-end.
- The server side use case brings **MongoDB and Mongoose to place #4 and #5**. We look at database connection trends in the next chapter. Note that MySQL also made it to the top 10 tags used with Node.js
- Server side would not be complete without **cloud platforms**. We see a few cloud solutions in the table above and as you see in the next figures several cloud solutions are growing rapidly in the Node.js arena.
- **Angular and React** are the hottest overall Javascript topics these days, they are often used together with Node.js, too.

## Growth trends of the key Javascript domains

Let's look at the trends in all of the above domains.

### Node.js in general

General Javascript trends based on the number of questions created per month as the percentage of all Javascript questions.

![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/njs-js-base-so-questions-trends-2018.png){:.img-fluid}{:.img-fluid}

As you can see in the picture, the number of Node.js questions is constantly growing, Typescript is growing at the same rate from the base Javascript toolkit.

### Server side frameworks, APIs and communications libraries

Picking the right tool for the job on the server side always requires great research (at least this is my experience :).

If you have your preferred technologies, you'd better review your preferences regularly to keep up with the trends.

Let's see some of the key server side components right here.

![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/njs-server-side-so-questions-trends-2018.png){:.img-fluid}

**Express** is the clear winner on the server side. Sails made it to the top 25 tags list above, but its usage shows decline.

**GraphQL and Axios** also demonstrate high growth, and more and more **communications and chat** solutions appear on the growth charts, like Discord or [Microsoft's bot framework](https://dev.botframework.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

### Database technologies

The figure shows the number of new monthly questions as a percentage of total questions on Stackoverflow. MySQL is still strong, MongoDB is constantly growing with Mongoose being the preferred way to connect.

The Firebase real-time database and Google Cloud Firestore are the other winners of the recent years.

### Cloud services

The next figure shows new monthly questions created for popular cloud solutions as the percentage of total monthly questions on Stackoverflow.

For now, let's note how Firebase is outperforming other players, and also note that the entire cloud ecosystem is in a stable growth phase.

![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/njs-devops-so-questions-per-total-2018.png){:.img-fluid}

### Web frameworks

I have already mentioned how Angular and React dominate the Javascript trends today. Let's see their growth numbers compared to the number of new Node.js questions a month.

![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/in-content/njs-web-frameworks-so-questions-trends-2018.png){:.img-fluid}

I also added a separate figure for less prominent frameworks; namely Nest, Next and Nuxt.

## Growth segments of the Javascript ecosystem

We have come to the sweet-spot of our article. It's time we look at the growth segments of the Node.js domain and set up your action plan based on our data driven findings.

Let's identify the high-growth domains of Node.js by looking at the **growth in question views** in the 6 month period between June 2018 and December 2018. _Note that this time we are looking at the number of question views, which I believe is the best measure of real-life usage._

We look at the details of the following segments:

- **Established technologies** - tags with over 4k Node.js related questions
- **Emerging technologies** - tags with 1k to 4k questions
- **Trending technologies** - tags with 500 to 1000 questions
- **Top newcomers** - tags with 50 to 500 questions

### Growth of established technologies

These are the heavy tags that have been around for long enough to have a stable user base and mature solutions. Users look at both old and new questions to find out how to solve daily challenges.

**These are industry trends you should be active in right now**.

- **Angular's and React's 40+% growth** in question views shows that the use of these technologies in real projects is growing continuously.
- Besides Angular and React **Express, MySQL and Mongo** are the technologies you should be working with.
- In the Node.js communications arena **socket.io** is the leading product.

> Actions you may take:
>
> - Use Angular or React to create fresh user experiences and applications for desktop and mobile.
> - Use Express with Node.
> - Connect your Node applications to MySQL and MongoDB.
> - Use [Socket.io](https://socket.io/){:target="\_blank"} for real-time bidirectional communication.
